Assignment 3

Included in this assignment submission are the following:
updated Compiler.java file
various tests for A3
makefile for easy compilation
AST, Environment, Semantic, IR, and Types packages


THINGS I KNOW DON'T WORK:
array variables as if statement condition
array variables as while statement condition
array variables as function parameters

function calls still create a temp (that temp is then never used)
